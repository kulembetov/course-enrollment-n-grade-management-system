# Course Enrollment and Grade Management System

This Java-based system is designed to streamline the process of managing course enrollments and student grades for educational institutions. It demonstrates the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, offering a comprehensive solution that encompasses course management, student enrollment, grade assignment, and overall grade calculation.

## System Overview

The system comprises four main components, each responsible for a set of functionalities that together create a robust and user-friendly academic administration tool.

### Classes

#### Student

The `Student` class is at the heart of our system, acting as the guardian of student information. It meticulously manages details like names, IDs, and courses enrolled, with a keen eye on data integrity and privacy. Through its public interfaces, it allows for seamless interactions, enabling students to embark on their educational journeys with ease and confidence.

#### Course

The `Course` class serves as the cornerstone of academic offerings, holding the keys to course codes, names, and capacities. It stands as a testament to the system's commitment to organization and efficiency, ensuring that the academic world's vibrant tapestry of learning opportunities is both accessible and well-managed.

#### CourseManagement

Acting as the orchestral conductor, the `CourseManagement` class brings harmony to the system, orchestrating the seamless flow of operations from course creation to student enrollment. It embodies the system's intelligence, ensuring that every note in the academic symphony is played to perfection, and every student's educational melody reaches its full potential.

#### AdministratorInterface

The `AdministratorInterface` class is the gateway to the system, offering administrators a powerful yet intuitive toolset to conduct the symphony of academic administration. With simplicity and efficiency at its core, it invites administrators to engage in the art of education management, transforming complex tasks into a series of simple, harmonious interactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Course Enrollment and Grade Management System, compile and run the `AdministratorInterface.java` file. This will launch the command-line interface through which you can interact with the system, performing tasks such as adding courses, enrolling students, assigning grades, and calculating overall grades.

## Conclusion

The Course Enrollment and Grade Management System is not just a tool but a beacon of efficiency and organization in the academic world. It stands as a testament to the power of Java and OOP in creating solutions that not only solve real-world problems but also enhance the educational journey for students and administrators alike.
